        <h1>About us</h1>
        <br />
          <b>Welcome</b> to ΦuterCorpo, your best source of software. Our goal
          is to deliver the best software, with an emphasis on scalability and
          dynamics. Founded in 2136 by Abdul Amulami, OuterCorpo has come a
          long way from its beginnings in the new Some City. When Abdul Amulami
           started his business, his passion for programming and
          software development prompted them to quit their jobs so that
          OuterCorpo could offer irreplaceable software. We currently serve
          customers all over the world and we are delighted to be able to turn
          our passion into our own business. We hope that you will like our
          products as much as we offer them. If you have any questions or
          comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
        </p>
